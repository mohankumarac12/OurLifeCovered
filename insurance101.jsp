                                <p>Death isn't a typical concern for young healthy people. Term life insurance is often the best option for protecting against the unexpected. It provides coverage for a specific period of time, and is designed to help your loved ones make up for the loss of your income if something were to happen to you.</p>
                                <p>In doing so, it covers financial obligations that disappear over time, such as a mortgage, college tuition and loans. The healthier and younger you are, the more affordable coverage will be.</p>
